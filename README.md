This is a minimal experimental implementation of the raw vs stabilised heat kernel comparison.

To avoid extra files in the directory, run: `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python compare_raw_vs_stabilised_sinkhorn.py`.

Alternatively, run `python compare_raw_vs_stabilised_sinkhorn.py` or `python3 compare_raw_vs_stabilised_sinkhorn.py` if you have a different environment. This command will run through all graph families and generate the plots and csv results in this directory. You may also adjust the parameters directly in the code and compare the results.
